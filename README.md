# Flappy-Bird-
A simple Flappy Bird game made using Unity Game engine. I used components like RigidBody2D to add gravity and physics, Colliders to detect when the bird hits the pipes, and renderers. All the game scripts for the bird, pipes, score card, etc. are written in C# for which I used Visual Studio.
